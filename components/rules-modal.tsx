							Pick seven characters you think will perish in season{' '}
							{CURRENT_SEASON}.
						</li>
						<li>Rank your picks on how confident you are each will die.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								For example: If youâ€™re 100% positive that Cersei Lannister will
								die this season, you would pick her and assign 7 points (the
								maximum amount) to her.
							</li>
							<li>
								After Cersei dies you think Arya Stark will die, you might
								choose Arya and assign 6 points to her character.
							</li>
							<li>
								Continue this until all seven characters are chosen and assigned
								a point value.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							If you choose correctly and that character dies by the end of
							season {CURRENT_SEASON}, you are awarded the points you assigned
							to the character.
						</li>
						<li>
							A character is considered dead if they are still dead by the
							curtain closing of season {CURRENT_SEASON}.
						</li>
						<li>
							A character turning into a member of the army of the dead is still
							considered dead.
						</li>
						<li>
							The players ranked 1st and 2nd at the end of the season will take
							the 1st and 2nd place winnings.
						</li>
						<li>
							Before you can submit your picks, you must submit a tiebreaker.
						</li>
						<li>
							Your guess should be as close to the total number of listed
							characters to die without going over.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the two closest guesses are over, the closest to the actual
							number will win.
						</li>
						<li>
							In the event of a tie for end of season points AND a tie for the
							tiebreaker, the players involved will split the pot.
						</li>
